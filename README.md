This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This is Iota.org clone in Next.js.
All resurces are belong to them and nothing here is allowed to be used for commercial use!

The clone is for practice only and you guys can use diferent resources and use it as a template (altouth many thing arent complete yet such as routing and Links between pages)

Best,
Naveh
